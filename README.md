# waaca-bathroom-scale
Waaca is a Smart Systems Engineering course project in which LabVIEW programming and electronic schematic design were central. We created the software and hardware for a bathroom scale from scratch. The course was closely tied to a Virtual Instrumentation course in which we utilized Texas Instrument's LabVIEW training materials.
